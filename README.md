# ML.NET tutorial

This repository contains slides for an introductory talk about ML.NET library.

Download slides as [PowerPoint](slides.pptx) or [PDF](slides.pdf).

This repository comes hand in hand with a workshop from Global AI Community. Refer
to it's [tutorial](https://globalaicommunity.github.io/Workshop-MLNet/#/) materials.
I recommend you to start with the source code in `completed` folder and learn from it.

Have a look at a sample project [Object Detection](https://github.com/fralik/ObjectDetection-MLNet),
which shows how one can use a pre-trained neural network to detect objects from a webcam
live feed.
